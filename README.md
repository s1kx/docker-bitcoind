# docker-bitcoind

Dockerized bitcoin-core (Work in progress)


## Mission

Run your bitcoin node with various configurations and environments.

It's time to secure your valuable assets from vulnerabilities in other software.

**Ready to sandbox? Let's do it.**


## How?

Say you want to run a bitcoin node on a server, connect your Armory client and 
sleep with the peace of knowing that if one part of your docker stack is vulnerable,
your wallets and node will be safe.

Pull the [docker-armorydb](https://github.com/s1kx/docker-armorydb) image and set up a `docker-compose` project. (Example coming)

Now connect your Armory client to the node and continue working on whatever you're doing.
It's that simple.
